          The universe is everything. It includes all of space, matter, energy,
          time, and you.
        </h3>
        <br /> NASA’s Astrophysics Division is dedicated to exploring the
        universe, pushing the boundaries of what is known of the cosmos, and
        sharing its discoveries with the world. The Division continues expanding
        humanity’s understanding of how the universe began and evolved, how it
        works, and whether there are places beyond Earth where life might
        thrive. By working together with collaborators and academic partners
        from all over the world, NASA researchers are making progress towards
        addressing these tantalizing scientific goals with leading-edge
        technologies and groundbreaking science.
